📚 Study Material
The following concepts and resources, taken from this book, cover the material needed for
this task.
Resources
Part 1 — Chapter 2: The AI Turning Point
Part 1 — Chapter 4: The Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development
Key Concepts to Understand

Concept Description
3-Layer Architecture Modular stack (Models → IDEs → Agents)
separating intelligence, workspace, and
orchestration

Vibe Coding Coding without planning/specs — developer
“vibes” into the code relying on intuition

Specification-Driven
Development (SDD)

Writing clear, executable specifications before
implementation — formalizing human intent
The Nine Pillars Integrated system (TDD, AI CLI, MCP, agents,
specs, etc.) allowing a single developer to
function like an entire team

M-Shaped Developer Developer with deep expertise in 2–4
complementary domains — enabled by AI
bridging knowledge gaps

Development Agents Autonomous Layer-3 tools (Gemini CLI, Claude
Code, etc.) executing multi-step tasks from
high-level instructions

📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)
Answer in your own wording
1. Nine Pillars Understanding
Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
better for your growth as a system architect?
Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer.
2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?
How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?
3. Architecture Thinking
How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?
Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

📁 Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)
Task:
Using any AI CLI tool, generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function.
Requirements:
Must contain “@”
Must contain a valid domain (e.g., .com, .org)
Should return clear error messages
Submission:
1️⃣ Your exact CLI prompt (text or screenshot)
2️⃣ The 1-paragraph specification generated by the CLI
📁Part C — Multiple Choice Questions
1. What is the main purpose of Spec-Driven Development?
A. Make coding faster
B. Clear requirements before coding begins
C. Remove developers
D. Avoid documentation
2. What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?
A. Writing more code manually
B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions
C. Memorizing more syntax
D. Working without any tools
3. Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?
A. AI stops responding
B. Architecture becomes hard to extend
C. Code runs slow
D. Fewer comments written
4. Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?
A. They replace the developer completely
B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving
C. Make coding faster but less reliable
D. Make coding optional
5. What defines an M-Shaped Developer?
A. Knows little about everything
B. Deep in only one field
C. Deep skills in multiple related domains
D. Works without AI tools
🌟 Reflection

This task highlights how rapidly the developer role is evolving in the AI-Native era. Concepts
like the Nine Pillars, SDD, and Development Agents are not just tools—they represent a
complete shift in how software is planned, built, and maintained.
By practicing architecture-first thinking and learning to collaborate with agents, developers
can grow from code writers into system-level thinkers, eventually becoming M-Shaped
professionals who combine multiple deep skills with intelligent tooling.
